# Rice yield

* molecular mechanisms underlying agronomic traits
* genes & QTLs for enhancing grain yield

# Structure of rice inflorescence

* tillering
* grass inflorescnce structure defined by arrangement of spikelets
* describe arrangement of spikelets in detail, e.g. terminal, axillary spikelet 

# Relationship between branching and yield

* include tillering and panicle branching (both related to yield)
* pruscelnicz or whatever, determinancy paper

# Variation in architecture

* subpopulations, subspecies. See Crowell GWAS paper for ideas
* differences between African and Asian species
* Comparison of branching phenotypes across Oryza spp

# Molecular control of branching during inflorescence development

* describe all stages of meristem transitions

# Genes and pathways involved in meristem transitions

* much more detail than highlighting one or two genes
* include models of gene interactions, GRNs, etc
* mention LMD work

# Changes in phenotype related to domestication

# Comparison of gene expression in Oryza spp

# Changes in expression related to domestication

# Comparison with GWAS data
