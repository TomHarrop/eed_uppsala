# Branching in rice: tillering and panicle branches


# Rice yield

* molecular mechanisms underlying agronomic traits
* **genes & QTLs for enhancing grain yield**
* **why rice is a model for cereal yield**

# Structure of rice inflorescence

* tillering:
    - MOC1 mutants (GRAS transcription factor) don't initiate axillary mersitems / tiller buds and only have one culm (culm = tiller, branch)
    - OsTB1: controls outgrowth of tiller buds
* grass inflorescnce structure defined by arrangement of spikelets
* describe arrangement of spikelets in detail, e.g. terminal, axillary spikelet
* photo of o. sativa panicle vs. schematic of panicle architecture

# Relationship between branching and yield

* include tillering and panicle branching (both related to yield)
* pruscelnicz or whatever, determinancy paper
* large number of phenotypes, maybe negative interactions b/w (refs in Crowell)

# Variation in architecture

* subpopulations, subspecies. See Crowell GWAS paper for ideas
* differences between African and Asian species
* ORIGIN OF THE DOMESTICATIONS!!! IMPORTANT
* relative divergence time of species
* stress parallel changes
* effects of domestication
* Comparison of branching phenotypes across Oryza spp
    - mention intra-specific variation used to find mol mechanisms e.g. WFP/DEP

# Molecular control of branching during inflorescence development

* describe all stages of meristem transitions
* primary/secondary BM generated from periphery of SAM ("Branching in Rice")
* compare with arabidopsis (continual production of FM from IM)

# Genes and pathways involved in meristem transitions

* regulatory mechanisms underlying the formation of grass inflorescence branches
* much more detail than highlighting one or two genes
* focus on WFP and DEP1 (major QTLs, related to yield)
* include models of gene interactions, GRNs, etc
* mention LMD work

# Changes in phenotype related to domestication

# Comparison of gene expression in Oryza spp

* remember to check the number of genes if indica/japonica domestications are considered separately
* SAP11 (asian dom): relationship b/w giberrelin, cell elongation and branching
* what links the "sets" of genes?

# Changes in expression related to domestication

# Comparison with GWAS data

# More about AP2 genes

* Coordinated regulation of vegetative and reproductive branching in rice (wang)

# Results overview:

domestication genes -> AP2 genes in expt -> AP2 genes in LMD -> roles of AP2 genes in branching

# Conclusion (three key points)

* parallel changes in branching phenotype in two separate domestications
* Suggest small changes in regulation of "sets" of genes
    - are they acting in the same pathways
    - are they downstream targets of the same gene(s)
* Altered expression at family level
    - Transcription factors
    - Involvement of AP2 transcription factors
* need mutants

# Other notes:

* tomato branching: iterative, "sympodial" growth: sympodial shoot meristem produces three leaves, a terminal inflorescence and the next sympodial shoot meristem
* japonica/indica: varietal groups/subpopulations
* axillary bud formation could have a common controlling mechanism at vegetative and reproductive stages
