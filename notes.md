1. Title slide

* rice is an important staple
* growth of yield potential has slowed
* because of population growth and decreasing resources an increase in rice yield potential is necessary
* interested in the molecular mechanisms responsible for differences in agronomic traits in wild and domesticated rice
* understanding of basic mechanisms

2. Tillering

* branching partially determines grain yield in two ways
* tillers are grain-bearing side branches that grow off the main stems in monocot plants
* tillers are produced during vegetative growth from meristems that form at the axils, where the leaf joins the stem
