1. Title slide

* interested in the molecular mechanisms responsible for differences in agronomic traits in wild and domesticated rice
* understanding of basic mechanisms of branching in rice inflorescences and their relation to yield

2. Tillering

* branching partially determines grain yield at two stages of development
* tillers are inflorescence-bearing side branches that grow off the main stems in monocot plants
* tillers are produced during vegetative growth from meristems that form at the axils, where the leaf joins the stem
* number of tillers in the adult plant determines the number of inflorescences, which bear the grain

3. Inflorescence development

* later, in reproductive development, branching determines inflorescence architecture
* classified as a panicle in rice
* main axis == rachis
* primary branches emerge from nodes on the rachis
* secondary branches attached to primary branches
* spikelets are short branches on the primary and secondary branches
* each spikelet bears one grain and spikelets are the individual floral units of the rice inflorescence
* number of spikelets is a main component of grain yield
* differences in branching process result in morphological differences between inflorescences within and between species

4.Inter-species diversity

* interested in:
    - basic molecular mechanisms controlling panicle branching in rice
    - variation within species that could be useful for breeding
    - molecular mechanisms responsible for parallel phenotypic changes in rice domestication
* at least two independent domestications of rice in africa and asia
* O. rufipogon -> O. sativa (japonica) around 8000 y.a. in Southern China
* two varietal groups of sativa, Japonica and Indica, may have been independently domesticated with introgression from japonica, potentially in the Ganges plains in India
* O. barthii -> O. glaberrima (around 3000 y.a. around Niger river in Africa)
* panicle phenotype has been under selection in (at least) two independent domestications of rice
* parallel changes in inflorescence architecture: increasing complexity of branching, larger panicle, higher number of grain, other traits
* phenotyping of five varieties from four different species grown under the same conditions
* parallel increases in spikelet number, primary and secondary branch number

5. Molecular control of branching

* branching is specified within the first 8–10 days of panicle development
* Conversion of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to the rachis meristem (RM)
* After the establishment of the RM, peripheral primary branch meristems are established (PBM)
* After formation of primary branches primary  branches  elongate (ePBM). the apex retains meristem activity and can give rise to axillary meristems (AM)
* AM may differentiate into secondary and higher-order branches or be converted directly to spikelet meristem
* Spikelet meristem is the determinate phase of development
* After spikelet differentiation complexity is fixed, and the branches elongate flowers develop
* Two stages where phase transition of meristems conditions branching:
    - Timing of rachis meristem abortion determines the number of primary branches.
    - Transition of indeterminate branch meristems to determinate spikelet meristems specifies the complexity of branching
    - delays in SM specification lead to reiteration of branching (more yield potential)
* APO1/APO2, UFO/LFY homologs, maintain BM identity and suppress SM identity. Increase in APO1 expression leads to prolonged indeterminate meristem fate and delays in SM specification
* TAW1 promotes BM and suppresses SM. in o/e mutants BM formation is reiterated. in KD spikelets form precociously.
* PAP2 (MADS32, SEP) positively regulates SM identity

6. RNA-seq experiment

* transcriptomic approach to look at this in five different varieties from four species
* whole panicles collected at two developmental stages:
    - the primary branching stage before the differentiation of SM, while the BMs are indeterminate
    - the SM stage when all BMs have differentiated into SM
* used for whole-transcriptome sequencing

Pre-7.

* explain plots:
    - attempting to compare the change in expression from indeterminate (PBM) to determinate (SM) panicles between species
    - x-axis is the LFC between PBM and SM
    - a gene at zero would have the same expression between the two dev stages
    - a gene to the left decreases expression between PBM–SM
    - a gene to the right increases expression
    - colour of the dot represents the average expression in the species on a Log2 scale
    - the wild species is marked with a blue box
    - use generalised linear models to detect genes where the change in expression between developmental stages is different in different species

7. Domestication of Asian rice

* set of genes in the wild species that decrease in expression between PBM and SM in the wild species, but not in one or both of the domesticated species
* SAP11 / DOG: AN1 zinc-finger protein, involved in regulation of gibberellin biosynthesis (10.1016/j.jplph.2010.12.013)
* other unannotated TFs
* 4 AP2 transcription factors

8. Domestication of African rice

* detected more genes in African rice but this pattern of "loss of decreased expression" in SM is not present
* again many transcription factors
* what the link is between all of these genes

9. Parallel evolution

* genes that have changed expression in the same direction both in domestication of african and asian rice
* rpt of pattern seen in Asian domestication
* don't know what the mechanism could be
    - upstream regulator?
    - act in the same pathway or have redundant functions?

10. AP2 genes

* briefly mention known functions of AP2 TFs (not new that they are involved in branching)
    - FZP: required for SM identity, suppresses axillary meristem formation
    - SNB: mutants produce fewer primary branches, fits with LMD expression pattern 
    - IDS: mutants produce fewer branches and spikelets
    - targeted by miRNAs
* what is interesting is the evidence that changes in phenotype are accompanied by changes in expression of several members of gene families

11. AP2 genes (laser microdissetion)

* RNA-sequencing experiment
* LMD of meristematic tissues in developing O. sativa japonica

12. AP2 genes (LMD results)

* groups of ap2 genes expressed dynamically in different meristem types consistent with a role in branching

13. Conclusion

* artificial selection for increased grain yield in two domesticated rice species
    - opportunity to study mechanisms responsible for parallel changes in branching phenotype
* Suggest small changes in regulation of "sets" of genes
    - set of genes that decrease in expression between indeterminate and determinate panicles in wild species but not in domesticated species
    - are they acting in the same pathways
    - are they downstream targets of the same gene(s)
* Altered expression at family level
    - transcription factors
    - involvement of AP2 transcription factors
* Looking for other evidence of selection around these genes in resequencing panels and other data
